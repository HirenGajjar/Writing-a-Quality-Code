The quality of code can be improved in many ways, but two of the most important ways to do so are the use of common sense and avoiding technically complex writing.

- As the first article from Stack Overflow suggests:

Higher-quality code means lower costs. How? Better code improves readability and reduces debugging time.

***Everyone can write better code by:***

~~Using names thoughtfully.~~
1. Using names thoughtfully
2. Using necessary comments
3. Building small functions with severely limited functionalities

- The second article from InformIT suggests:

**Diomidis Spinellis** Wrote a book called ***Code Quality: The Open Source Perspective***

1. Maintain consistency throughout the code
2. Effectively use DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) to avoid repetition
3. Do not overdesign

- The third article from MetaBox suggests:

***Why coders should focus on clean code, especially in PHP, for certain reasons:***

1. Clean code takes less time to read and write; therefore, not only coders but others can read it and have a basic understanding of it
2. Use documentation while coding so that organizations or others can use it
3. While working on WordPress or other open-source projects that may have strict coding rules, having good practice in producing quality code can definitely help.

For example, WordPress asks to write the full PHP tag as follows:

```PHP
<?php echo 'Hello World'; ?>
```
However, an updated version like 5.4 allows for short tags:

```PHP
<?= 'Hello World'; ?>
```

- Last but not least, an article from Soulimaneyh on Medium suggests:
### Article Link: https://medium.com/@soulaimaneyh/php-clean-code-tricks-everyone-should-know-afd406bd00bc#:~:text=Consistency%20is%20key%20when%20it,lengths%2C%20and%20other%20formatting%20conventions

***PHP, as a language, offers many features and tools to write effectively.***
Here's how?

1. Follow standards like PSR-1 and PSR-2 for indications, line length, and formation
2. Use default functions provided by PHP, such as array_filter(), array_insert(), etc
3. Utilize open-source libraries like CORS, Tinker, and Entrust

# Summary
- Naming conventions, comments, and precise functions
- Be consistent, avoid repetition, and be specific when building features
- Code should be written in a way that helps others understand it; documentation and following higher standards can help in open-source contributions
